Changelog:

1.1 - 2018-10-03
    - Added a second speed mode which is accesible by pressing the control key (shift: slow, control: fast)
    - Changed the optionVar names to reflect the new speed settings.
    - The executing _place() method now directly receives the modifier key instead of just a boolean to turn move mode on or off.
    - Fixed a stutter during the placing when the object to place moved under the cursor and gets picked as the object to drag on.

1.0 - 2018-10-02
    - Initial version.
