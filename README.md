# Place Reflection & Quick Zoom
Maya tools: Perform a reflection-based placement of lights (or any other object) on a mesh or quickly quickly set the 2D pan/zoom of the current camera.

Even though the tool is Open Source we appreciate if you would consider support for continued development via [Gumroad](https://braverabbit.gumroad.com/l/placeReflectionMaya)
